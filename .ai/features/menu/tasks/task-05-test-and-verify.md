## Objective
Perform comprehensive testing of the navigation menu across different viewports, browsers, and user scenarios.

## Testing Checklist

### Visual Testing

#### Mobile View (< 768px)
- [ ] Hamburger icon displays correctly
- [ ] Menu hidden by default

- [ ] Menu closes when hamburger clicked again
- [ ] Menu closes when clicking outside
- [ ] Menu animates smoothly

### Responsive Testing

#### Breakpoints
- [ ] Test at exactly 768px (breakpoint)
- [ ] Test at 375px (mobile)
- [ ] Test at 1024px (tablet)
- [ ] Test at 1440px (desktop)
- [ ] Test at various sizes between breakpoints

#### Browser Testing
- [ ] Chrome/Chromium
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari (if available)
- [ ] Edge
- [ ] Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

### Accessibility Testing

#### Keyboard Navigation

```

## Issues to Watch For
- Focus traps
- Scroll issues when menu opens
- Z-index conflicts
- Animation jank
- Memory leaks from event listeners
- ARIA attribute sync issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All visual tests pass
